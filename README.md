<h2 id="scenario4"> :moyai: WHY</h2>

The demand was high for this, so naturally, I had to create this tool for all those developers out there who cherish both terminal applications and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. They say success lies in finding a niche, but I really believe you can build something for the masses. And while I could be rolling in cash from this, itâ€™s all free. Enjoy!
